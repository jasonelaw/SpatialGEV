\title{Posterior draw coverage check}
\usage{
check_draws_coverage(y, draws, expected_covr = seq(0.1, 0.99, by = 0.01))
}
\arguments{
\item{y}{A vector of length \code{n} containing the true observations. We would like to check if the true observation at each location is covered in the posterior draw.}

\item{draws}{An \verb{n x k} matrix with \code{n} being the number of draws from the posterior predictive distribution and \code{k} being the number of locations}

\item{expected_covr}{A vector of length \code{m} containing the expected lengths of credible intervals to look at}
}
\value{
A vector of \code{m}. The i-th entry is the proportion of locations at which the true observation is contained
in the equal-tail credible interval given by the posterior draws, with the length of credible interval given by the i-th entry
in \code{expected_covr}.
