#' Posterior draw coverage check
#'
#' @param y A vector of length `n` containing the true observations. We would like to check if the true observation at each location is covered in the posterior draw.
#' @param draws An `n x k` matrix with `n` being the number of draws from the posterior predictive distribution and `k` being the number of locations
#' @param expected_covr A vector of length `m` containing the expected lengths of credible intervals to look at 
#' @param ci.method Either "HDI" (default) or "ETI" for calculating the credible intervals. The former is the highest density interval and the latter is the equal tail interval.
#' @return A vector of `m`. The i-th entry is the proportion of locations at which the true observation is contained 
#' in the credible interval given by the posterior draws, with the length of credible interval given by the i-th entry 
#' in `expected_covr`.
